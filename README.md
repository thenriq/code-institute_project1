    ## Testing

    - Tests were performed on different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge.
    - During tests, it was confirmed that the website is fully responsive. Extra care was taken in regards to performance for mobile devices, by setting smaller images for these devices.
    - All the 3 pages are all readable and easy to understand.
    - The fields in the contact form will required entries in every field, only email will be accepted in the email field and the button submit works well

    <br>

    ## Bugs
    - After deployed the project to GitHub Pages, I found that the contac form was covering the footer when using the website on a mobile device. 
    - It was fixed by reducing the font size on the form header, which was breaking into 3 lines, pushing all the fields down.
